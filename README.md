# Accessing-an-enterprise-bean
Java EE, Wildfly, Stateless bean

# Introduction:

The requirements for this assignment were to develope a java EE application and a relative Client
used to call the bean method developed in the enterprise application.
The java Enterprise application had to be deployed using Wildlfy (version 9.0.1. Final), an
application server that implements the Java EE specification.
In particular the enterpprise bean has to contain a method used to return a string containing current
date and time. The Client instead (a simple java application), will call the method present in the
bean twice and then print out its output.
The program requirements seems to be very simple, but the core of this assignment was centered on
the wildfly installation and to deploy an enterprise bean on it, since it was the first time that we had
to handle with this framework.
